## Target Audience
This guide is oriented towards teams that are interested in building a flight computer from Arduino components. Teams that undertake this

## Hardware Requirements

### Arduino Nano


### Micro SD Card Adapter


### BMP 280
This is a temperature and pressure sensor. Because air pressure is related to altitude, we can use this sensor as an altimeter. Per the spec sheet, the sensor provides an accuracy for altitude of (+/-) 1 meter, but your mileage may vary.

### Optional but Recommended: Prototyping Equipment

## Setting up the Software
