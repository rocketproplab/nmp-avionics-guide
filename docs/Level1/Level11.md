# Setting up the Software

You will need two programs for this level of Avionics:

- The Arduino IDE is used for writing code, managing external libraries, and uploading programs to the Arduino Nano.
- The SD Consortium Formatting Utility is used to format our MicroSD card to ensure its file system is configured in a way that is compatible with Arduino.

## Arduino IDE

You can get the Arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Install it like any other program before continuing.

## SD Consortium Formatting Utility

You can get the SD Consortium Formatting Utility [here](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/). Install it like any other program before continuing.

## Reboot Your Computer

It is always a good idea to reboot your computer once large development programs are installed.
