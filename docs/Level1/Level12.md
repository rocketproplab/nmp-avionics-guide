# Arduino "Hello, World!"

## Mount Arduino to Breadboard
Before we write any code, let's mount our Arduino to our breadboard. This does not do anything immediate, but it prepares our Arduino for prototyping with wires later.

The following gif demonstrates the mounting process.

What this effectively does is expand the number of connections for each Arduino pin. On the central part of the breadboard, each numbered row is connected together.

Later, this will allow us to easily connect modules together by plugging jumper cables into the breadboard. Why not connect the jumper cables directly? This is a valid course of action, but the breadboard makes it easier to see what is going on at a quick glance. Additionally, a breadboard allows us to connect multiple modules to single pins, which will be important for later parts of this guide.
